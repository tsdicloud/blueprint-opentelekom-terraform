This is a blueprint terrafrom playbook extracted from a complex real world project for Open Telekom Cloud.

NOTE that this is not a fully executable project. But it contains a lot of solutions, as well as tips and tricks for terraform and the OpenTelekomTerraform plugin from https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-opentelekomcloud

It is recommended to preferrably compile the plugin directly from the repo. Official releases of the plugin within the terraform package are rare. See install.sh for an installation script on CENTOS
